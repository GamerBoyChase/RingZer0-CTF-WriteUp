<H1>Big Brother is watching </H1>
<p> So this challenge is an easy one. The hint is even Google cannot find this one.
So we are looking for the robots.txt.</p>

<p> To learn more about the robots.txt file: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard
<p>

<p>So by navigating to https://ringzer0team.com/robots.txt. we can see there is an url
that is Disallow <b>/16bfff59f7e8343a2643bdc2ee76b2dc/</b> so by looking at that
url we can see the flag.<p>

<p> As a funny story I had a little problem with this challenge I misspelled robots.txt as
robot.txt. I had me stump for a while until I found my error. </p>
