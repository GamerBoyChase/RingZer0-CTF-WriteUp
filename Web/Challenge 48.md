<H1> Challenge 48: Area 51 </H1>
<p> The main task is to access the restricted area on the page which is using a .htacces. </p>

1. You need a REST client to send request. I used simple REST Client on chrome to do this.

2. You need to send a PUT request to the page.

3. With the response we can see the flag appear.

```<div class="challenge-wrapper">
            <br />
            <span class="red">AREA 51</span> The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear? Alien?<br /><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">FLAG-***********</div>                        <br />
            <br />
        </div>
```
